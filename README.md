# Guide: Switching from Windows to Linux on a ThinkPad T480

I am a student at FIIT STU and decided to switch from Linux to Windows due to the fact how Linux is just better OS for developers. I'm using Windows since I ever started using a computer. In this guide, I'll narrate mine troubles I had to deal with when switching and describe the overall experience.

> ## The starter of this idea was upgrading my laptop Thinkpad T480

I bought a fairly new T480 from a second-hand shop for half of the price I would pay if I would buy it new from the store. I read a lot of reddit posts on r/thinkpad that were warning about the risks of buying used Thinkpads on retails, etc. [This tutorial helped me a lot](https://www.bobble.tech/free-stuff/used-thinkpad-buyers-guide) when considering to buy from second-hand.
